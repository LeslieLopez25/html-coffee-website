<h1>Coffetto :coffee:</h1>

<h2>A coffee website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show active section links, show scroll up, change background header, and scroll reveal animation. I created this following the tutorial of Bedimcode. Screenshot of the website.</p>
